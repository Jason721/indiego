# Hugo Starter Kit

Indiego is a **starter kit** for the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) <abbr title="Content Management System">CMS</abbr>, designed for frontend developers. It has two features:

1. [Socially-aware](/social/) blog & status posts that can be previewed on social networks.
2. [Modular CSS](/modular/) frontend workflow, makes design & developing a theme much easier.

We want Indiego to simplify the [Indieweb](https://indieweb.org/), so that content creators can focus on [Publish (on your) Own Site, Syndicate Elsewhere](https://indieweb.org/POSSE). This means **easily** syndicating your web site content to your social media networks.

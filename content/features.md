## Feature branch file differences

Created a new theme for each feature branch called `goplus`. This makes it easier to merge the default theme `go` from the master branch.

### [Progressive Web App](https://pwa.indiego.org.uk/)

This is a manual process at the moment. There is a [Real Favicon Generator plugin for Gulp](https://realfavicongenerator.net/favicon/gulp) but I think the amount of complexity involved in setting it up isn't worth it for this project, so all the favicon generation is done via the website. It is also possible to put site variables into the `manifest.json` by [creating a custom output in Hugo](https://gohugo.io/templates/output-formats/) but again, havenâ€™t done this.

Indiego is a **starter** kit for the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) CMS, meaning it’s as [vanilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanilla_software) as possible, so you have less clearing up to do.

You need to delete all the styles in [`shame.css`](https://github.com/growdigital/indiego/blob/master/themes/indiegomin/src/css/shame.css), then start to build out your own designs with the [Gulp](https://gulpjs.com/) workflow. 

More details on how to do that in later blog posts!
